    <h1>I AM MICHAEL JACKSON REINCARNATED</h1>
    <h2>My mother keeps informing that I am in fact not Michael Jackson reincarnated but she just doesn't understand.</h2>
    <h3>My therapist keeps telling me that I am not in fact the literal reincarnation of the greatest musician ever made but I keep telling him he is wrong and stupid.</h3> 
    <p>All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
      Don't worry what people say, we know the truth
      All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
      Enough is enough of this garbage
      All I want to say is that they don't really care about us</p>

    <p>I am not crazy <span>nor making things up</span>. I did fall on my head <span>when I was a young child</span>, but I think I am good though, probably.</p>
    <p>I also may be Batman.<br/>I was also bit by a bat as a child.</p>   
    <p>If I were writing a book about my life,<hr/>I would probably use that.</p>
